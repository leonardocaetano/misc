on windows:

- download gvim portable from the official github page
- include vim on your path
- install liberation mono font
- install git
- create the $HOME global variable with the value 'c:\home\', without the '
- run windows_symlink.bat, this will create the c:\home\ folder as well
- on windows terminal, set the font to liberation mono as well, with size 12, you should also setup the cursor to be a filled box, also remove the left scroll bar

on linux:

- install git
- just clone this repo and run linux_symlink.sh, gvim on linux is not solved at this point, but terminal should be fine
- for ssh on windows, set the font on windows terminal to liberation mono 12 too, you should also setup the cursor to be a filled box, also remove the left scroll bar

note: we should setup a few git hooks to make this more elegant and manual, but meh atm
