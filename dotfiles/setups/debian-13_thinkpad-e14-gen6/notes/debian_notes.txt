- remember to go to /etc/network/interfaces and comment out the preseved wifi connection. this is important so the network manager applet works

- just leave the root password blank and create only the user one, the sudo permisions for the user will be created automatically

- for debian minimal, you can uncheck everything on that 'pick your DE' screen, even the "basic system utils"

- if debian minimal, install alsa-utils and pulseaudio for audio, that's enough

- keep it very minimal, i've only installed on this system so far: (you should try to stay on the terminal as much as possible, and use the browser for PDF reading or spreadcheets)
i3
firefox
nvim
p7zip
htop
screenfetch
alsa-utils
pulseaudio
man
git
curl
network-manager-applet
fsearch (voidtools' everything equivalent)
brightnessctl (for monitor sutff)
the nvidia driver stuff (go on debian wiki for instructions)
wezterm and neovide (appimages)
gh (the only external mirror one)

- fun i3 tip, to float window: shift + $mod + space, to resize it: $mod + right mouse
